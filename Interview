1. what is the most influential book or blog you have ever read regarding web development?
A. The most influential book, would have to be john resign javascript ninja
a complete concise quide to prototype javascript. These book impacted me when I was learning javascript to build my google play store game "Bruiser's Equinox Adventure, by allowing me to concieve the abastration in more detail since the game engine I used at the time cocos2d had only mandrin documentation on their engine and how to build games.

2. Tell me about a web application you have built. Why did you choose to build
it? What did you learn? What challenges did you face and how did you overcome them?

A.  A web application that I made for the udacity nano degree course is road map to health.
At first this app was just a requirement for my nano degree course, but then it become much more!
being a person of health myself, the main purpose of the application is an open source
database of medicine knowledge which allows an authenticated user to create
organ systems of the human body then populate that organ system with a medicine
product that pertains to aiding that system with the options of categorizing by glands and different
types of recognized medicine as well. I needed to learn the flask frame work and sql
to complete this project. At first getting my database to by the app was difficult
I quickly overcame this barrier by reading the documentation again.
 

3. Write a function in Python that takes a list of strings and returns a single
string that is an HTML unordered list (<ul>...</ul>) of those strings.
You should include a brief explanation of your code. Then, what would you have
to consider if the original list was provided by user input?

def unordered_list(strings):
	#unordered list element
	list = '<ul>'

	#iterate over input
	for s in strings:
	    #append and format elements
	    lst += '<li>{}<li>\n'.format(s)
         #close off the unordered object
         list += "</ul>"
return list

If the data input came from the user then the function would ned to check if 
the input was a list, not null, and is of type string!

4. List 2-3 attacks that web applications are vulnerable to. How do these
attacks work? How can we prevent those attacks?


5.Here is some starter code for a Flask Web Application. Expand on that and
include a route that simulates rolling two dice and returns the result in JSON.
You should include a brief explanation of your code.

from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)

import json
import random

@app.route('/')
def hello_world():
 return 'Hello World!'

if __name__ == '__main__':
 app.debug = True
 app.run()

6. If you were to start your full-stack developer position today, what would be
your goals a year from now?
